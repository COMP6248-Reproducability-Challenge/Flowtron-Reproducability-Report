# COMP6248 Reproducability challenge

This is the repo for our custom code and notebooks used during the coursework.

We trained a [Flowtron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flowtron) model, as well as a comparator [Tacotron 2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) model, using the 'Jane Eyre' subset of the uk-EN subset of the [M-AILABS Speech Dataset](https://www.caito.de/2019/01/03/the-m-ailabs-speech-dataset/).
