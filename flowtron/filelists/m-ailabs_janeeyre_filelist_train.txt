audio/jane_eyre_25_f000171.wav|I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source of your melancholy in a dream.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000153.wav|Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me - on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.|0

audio/jane_eyre_30_f000030.wav|In her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.|0

audio/jane_eyre_11_f000176.wav|I looked at my pupil, who did not at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale,|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000449.wav|What shall I do, Jane? Where turn for a companion and for some hope?|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000201.wav|their plates and glasses in their hands.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000271.wav|and with me, in, as you characteristically say, all that is right:|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000162.wav|for, after all, Mister Rochester and - because closely connected with him - Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000128.wav|Lastly, I saw Mister Mason was submissive to Mister Rochester;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000285.wav|I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000158.wav|I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries.|0

audio/jane_eyre_28_f000301.wav|Do let me speak to your mistresses.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000045.wav|and which seemed so to degrade me, left - I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000169.wav|I would rather be incensed than saddened.|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000080.wav|and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression - as running away,|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000068.wav|For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000264.wav|But there was something I wished to say - let me see - The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000013.wav|On Thursday afternoons half-holidays we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.|0

audio/jane_eyre_17_f000065.wav|I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave;|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000114.wav|Don't trouble yourself to give her a character, returned Mister Rochester: eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She began by felling my horse.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000219.wav|May it be right then, I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness to me;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000314.wav|I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large.|0

audio/jane_eyre_08_f000138.wav|About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple, who had written to Mister Lloyd, received his answer:|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000057.wav|He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000004.wav|Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in accomplishing her task;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000344.wav|She seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her;|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000191.wav|Here, come in, bonny wanderer!|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000087.wav|And you came from - ?|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000291.wav|Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000080.wav|The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mister St. John Rivers?|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000144.wav|I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum; but I dare not.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000195.wav|Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I pity him, for my part.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000195.wav|Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian?|0

audio/jane_eyre_37_f000263.wav|His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste? - priggish and parsonic?|0

audio/jane_eyre_22_f000077.wav|Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment I am beyond my own mastery.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000263.wav|Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him how to avert the danger.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000332.wav|St. John, who is it? I heard one ask.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000189.wav|she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes,|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000093.wav|he experienced, too, a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000052.wav|I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000085.wav|and while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000077.wav|I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Missis Fairfax showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry;|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000054.wav|Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast through the room and came back;|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000076.wav|Without speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.|0

audio/jane_eyre_15_f000157.wav|I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000183.wav|He went to college, and he got - plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man,|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000107.wav|Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements;|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000201.wav|That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000064.wav|But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but your future school?|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000229.wav|This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft: it is the work of nature. She was roused, and did - no miracle - but her best.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000256.wav|He is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to perform.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000113.wav|But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mister Rochester, to witness their repeated failure - herself unconscious that they did fail;|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000019.wav|perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and benefited them;|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000333.wav|She had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly handsome.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000049.wav|but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never lifted his head as we approached.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000150.wav|Ah! sir, she sees you! exclaimed Grace: you'd better not stay.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000341.wav|Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000021.wav|The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000348.wav|But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I do love you, you would be proud and content.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000029.wav|You are passionate. I expected a scene of some kind.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000153.wav|Mister Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000198.wav|a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud;|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000077.wav|I did not now watch the actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise;|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000215.wav|Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000193.wav|Sophie! Sophie! I again cried: and still it was silent.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000359.wav|Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000189.wav|The clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000064.wav|All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters proud indifference, all his mother's aversion,|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000086.wav|He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud personage; but he was very kind to me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000067.wav|What to do? - where to go?|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000148.wav|End of chapter 22.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000026.wav|when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the voiture I had given Celine.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000030.wav|I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000082.wav|Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in the glass, I said.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000172.wav|Hush! say nothing - my heart is full of delight - my senses are entranced - let the time I marked pass in peace.|0

audio/jane_eyre_34_f000082.wav|He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs,|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000109.wav|Very well, he answered quietly: and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000081.wav|chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study - and I was going to speak,|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000010.wav|This morning, the village school opened. I had twenty scholars.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000129.wav|and Mister Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him;|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000027.wav|Good morning, Grace, I said. Has anything happened here? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000355.wav|Theodore, do you remember those merry days?|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000233.wav|Put it, she said, on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000202.wav|By the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000043.wav|Some hated thought seemed to have him in its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000013.wav|Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation;|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000122.wav|but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her father had taught her,|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000135.wav|a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete change at least.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000342.wav|Very willingly, he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000393.wav|and as often on week-days as there were prayers.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000428.wav|There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never blight,|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000240.wav|I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000007.wav|and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000126.wav|Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000105.wav|There, sir - and there! I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes - I swept his hair from his brow, and kissed that too.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000020.wav|She was intent on her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed:|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000146.wav|If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000030.wav|had once saved my life, and that we were near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000051.wav|but then, I hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000143.wav|But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000179.wav|If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000027.wav|Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000143.wav|Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty:|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000208.wav|I hastened to Missis Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no candle, and no Missis Fairfax.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000453.wav|She said I oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000007.wav|the unity of the source to which each traces his origin whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000080.wav|A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her dupe.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000319.wav|Curse you? No, sir.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000024.wav|and crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000177.wav|St. John passed the window reading a letter. He entered.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000028.wav|I still again and again met Mister Rochester, always at some exciting crisis;|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000169.wav|Blind as he was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his lineaments softened and warmed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000224.wav|She made me lift my hand - so - to remind me to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000128.wav|Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions;|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000071.wav|though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000187.wav|The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000475.wav|I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after him - he stood at the foot of the stairs.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000075.wav|as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000115.wav|St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson;|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000253.wav|St John was only twenty-nine, sir.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000066.wav|Mister Rochester led in Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000185.wav|I have striven long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000171.wav|then judge me, priest of the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged!|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000387.wav|I should say the preference lies with you, responded Colonel Dent.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000334.wav|No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000315.wav|Her coming was my hope each day, Her parting was my pain;|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000129.wav|Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come. I had now got hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000127.wav|I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would fire,|0

audio/jane_eyre_29_f000081.wav|Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name.|0

audio/jane_eyre_30_f000145.wav|I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next week.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000086.wav|I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions:|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000261.wav|but I knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn,|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000058.wav|Yes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000089.wav|Mister Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000179.wav|No, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I never asked for what name it stood.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000307.wav|He did not understand German.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000092.wav|The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000014.wav|Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone through?|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000225.wav|Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind - good-bye, Dick.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000267.wav|Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, I should think.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000154.wav|She's done for me, I fear, was the faint reply.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000102.wav|She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000235.wav|You are quite right, I am sure, said Diana. Now do, brother, let her be at peace a while.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000052.wav|Meantime the moon declined: she was about to set. Not liking to sit in the cold and darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000035.wav|I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000157.wav|We had better leave her, whispered Mason.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000041.wav|Half reclined on a couch appeared Mister Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire shone full on his face.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000078.wav|On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000030.wav|It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000026.wav|Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning - she had already retired to a sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000501.wav|What unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was to reiterate firmly, I am going.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000023.wav|proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000165.wav|No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000050.wav|The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet crash down.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000054.wav|I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me:|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000054.wav|I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Missis Reed about my disposition, &c.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000377.wav|Most truly, sir.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000028.wav|you are sick; and you are silly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000193.wav|On closer examination, you detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to please.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000152.wav|That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000037.wav|His head was not strong: the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000208.wav|At first I could not make much sense of what I heard;|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000280.wav|The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to indulge in: somehow it pleased her.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000049.wav|It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.|0

audio/jane_eyre_17_f000417.wav|Thence a narrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose;|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000020.wav|But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know, despise me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000050.wav|The service began. The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mister|0

audio/jane_eyre_18_f000297.wav|She told us such things! She knows all about us! and they sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000029.wav|Is Miss Eyre there? now demanded the master, half rising from his seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.|0

audio/jane_eyre_27_f000496.wav|You are going, Jane?|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000269.wav|Yes, Mister Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before.|0

audio/jane_eyre_35_f000036.wav|I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any one ill;|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000113.wav|It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mister Rochester had told me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000172.wav|You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish Town, you may think of her as dead and buried - or rather, you need not think of her at all.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000033.wav|Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely impressive.|0

audio/jane_eyre_30_f000093.wav|I was obliged to recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000230.wav|She is lovely, he murmured. She is well named the Rose of the World, indeed!|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000047.wav|my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing:|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000093.wav|We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000337.wav|She had an alarm to call her up early. I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions,|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000071.wav|Generally thought? But what do you think?|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000170.wav|Wood and Briggs, look at the difference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder - this face with that mask - this form with that bulk;|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000241.wav|Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000044.wav|For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal fury - consequences of my departure - which might now,|0

audio/jane_eyre_09_f000014.wav|I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden:|0

audio/jane_eyre_06_f000066.wav|Do you come a long way from here?|0

audio/jane_eyre_04_f000196.wav|Missis Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was sewing, I was watching her.|0

audio/jane_eyre_21_f000050.wav|Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.|0

audio/jane_eyre_25_f000079.wav|Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.|0

audio/jane_eyre_18_f000221.wav|but I thought the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000082.wav|I entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000019.wav|Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000143.wav|I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mister Rochester quit Missis Fairfax's parlour, I hurried down to it.|0

audio/jane_eyre_11_f000268.wav|I dare say he is clever, but I never had much conversation with him.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000149.wav|I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000005.wav|Missis Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average intelligence.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000146.wav|I do love you, I said, more than ever: but I must not show or indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000278.wav|No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to his face;|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000068.wav|Happily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me. The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000120.wav|Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there stood a little crib.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000258.wav|He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had enriched:|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000017.wav|and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000035.wav|I caught scraps of their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000260.wav|I sit in the shade - if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the window-curtain half hides me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000062.wav|I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook entered.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000151.wav|I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk, - the same I had brought with me eight years ago from Gateshead.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000045.wav|You said I could not unless I married you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000051.wav|It seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000026.wav|And are the family well at the house, Robert?|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000041.wav|and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000181.wav|Helen Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000107.wav|Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely;|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000120.wav|I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then,|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000032.wav|Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some time been uneasy.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000127.wav|and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered,|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000042.wav|I pray God Missis Fairfax may not turn out a second Missis Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000120.wav|so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000097.wav|You touch me, sir, - you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000072.wav|But Servitude! That must be matter of fact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000110.wav|In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame - a voice wretchedly low and faltering - I asked if a servant was wanted here?|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000123.wav|I had heard Mister Rochester assign him an apartment below - what brought him here!|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000159.wav|But it was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident enough.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000115.wav|I looked in vain for her I had first seen the night before;|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000129.wav|I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth;|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000061.wav|A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on the truth.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000136.wav|it did not, however, wake the nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted;|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000040.wav|the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000209.wav|Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000214.wav|No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000309.wav|I have myself - I tell it you without parable - been a worldly, dissipated, restless man;|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000086.wav|Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give - Oh, no need to apologise!|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000040.wav|I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was not, at least - at the commencement of the night, cold.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000185.wav|John had said another word; but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his explanation.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000087.wav|Barbara, she said to the servant who answered it, I have not yet had tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000065.wav|Well, Jane? he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door, which he had shut.|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000117.wav|A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000100.wav|It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000088.wav|I deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000042.wav|and my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000447.wav|Jane, you would not repent marrying me - be certain of that; we must be married.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000100.wav|I have never heard Mister Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning;|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000126.wav|It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made:|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000378.wav|I said so. St. John, I returned, I regard you as a brother - you, me as a sister: so let us continue.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000032.wav|to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000040.wav|as yet, however, they might be said to form one tree - a ruin, but an entire ruin.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000131.wav|That feature too is propitious.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000237.wav|there the toilet-table, the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000005.wav|We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning;|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000323.wav|Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you to marry him?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000549.wav|All this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut it softly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000201.wav|John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000302.wav|Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened on these two last-named points;|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000293.wav|Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library;|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000363.wav|If I were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000038.wav|The drawing- room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining- room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the room,|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000280.wav|What questions, Mister Rochester?|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000148.wav|which might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000192.wav|let the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet;|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000081.wav|Had you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did you ever love such an one?|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000122.wav|St. John - you know him - would urge you to impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the hot hours;|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000061.wav|The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was grave, her bearing erect.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000051.wav|and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000045.wav|He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than cheerful - And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these easy tasks,|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000206.wav|In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000229.wav|and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000034.wav|But where am I wandering, and what am I saying, and above all, feeling?|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000023.wav|But let me not hate and despise myself too much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong - that is a great step gained;|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000131.wav|a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000187.wav|they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000167.wav|all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000106.wav|By the time that exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned.|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000005.wav|but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000117.wav|Yes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000080.wav|Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night? I asked, when I had partaken of what she offered me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000069.wav|Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands, she remarked. Happen ye've been a dressmaker?|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000091.wav|I will produce him first - he is on the spot. Mister Mason, have the goodness to step forward.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000061.wav|When she returned, I inquired what he had said. You are to send in your name and your business, she replied.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000116.wav|So much? was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes. Presently he addressed me - Your name, little girl?|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000095.wav|He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000378.wav|You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim:|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000098.wav|Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000375.wav|I suppose, now, said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant:|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000155.wav|I cannot commission you to fetch help, he said; but you may help me a little yourself, if you will be so kind.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000477.wav|Good-night, Jane, he replied calmly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000278.wav|she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000045.wav|Sometimes I saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return,|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000171.wav|Just put your hand in mine, Janet - that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight,|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000328.wav|Nor care I now, how dense and grim Disasters gather nigh.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000057.wav|I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000266.wav|Sit up! said she; don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are you Jane Eyre?|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000167.wav|The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at her voice.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000190.wav|Not at all - it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000185.wav|I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look;|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000006.wav|and a set of tea-things in delf.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000009.wav|But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that I should do it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000012.wav|I was now to become an actor therein.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000150.wav|They set out early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both the departure and the return.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000246.wav|I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000178.wav|Our uncle John is dead, said he.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000102.wav|I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have no wish to go to bed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000137.wav|No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000012.wav|I should insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000033.wav|nor were his features altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000054.wav|I want you to come here; and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000082.wav|spread their wings, and mount beyond ken.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000162.wav|I warned you, was his friend's answer; I said - be on your guard when you go near her.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000032.wav|A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at Mister Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000484.wav|End of chapter 34.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000228.wav|Is he a good man?|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000117.wav|Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000356.wav|By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I shall satisfy him - to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000006.wav|I said I could not bear such words now. That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my woe, I alleged:|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000361.wav|It is - that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000045.wav|a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples;|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000028.wav|That is hardly likely, was the reply. You will find she is some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably injudiciously left them.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000158.wav|There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most innocent life.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000083.wav|Rochester.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000015.wav|good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000031.wav|But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears. I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000037.wav|I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds;|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000183.wav|Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties;|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000018.wav|I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield;|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000151.wav|explore its secrets and analyse their nature.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000101.wav|You have seen love: have you not? - and, looking forward, you have seen him married, and beheld his bride happy?|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000150.wav|Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare - to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might look into the abyss at her leisure,|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000123.wav|John's taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000026.wav|I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close about her,|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000179.wav|In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000483.wav|And with that answer he left me. I would much rather he had knocked me down.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000053.wav|only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000027.wav|before him, on a table, lay open a large book;|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000048.wav|I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000394.wav|I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who lay there almost unheeded:|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000085.wav|at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000205.wav|I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: he expected me to do a great deal;|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000169.wav|I should think it may have: I should hope - better.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000083.wav|I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another day.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000046.wav|My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems;|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000080.wav|but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages. Mister|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000335.wav|When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget that you have formed a new tie. But I am not a fool - go - Where must I go, sir?|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000352.wav|and Missis Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000078.wav|and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000118.wav|her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000191.wav|This pale crescent was the likeness of a kingly crown; what it diademed was the shape which shape had none.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000272.wav|I would have no mercy, Mister Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an eye like that.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000117.wav|Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter? - of the new life into which you are passing?|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000168.wav|Would not such another ruin you?|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000174.wav|that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his plans.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000010.wav|His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.|0

audio/jane_eyre_15_f000088.wav|Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to see you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000140.wav|Did she think, Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000209.wav|unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you will see in the yard - or just outside,|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000081.wav|Favour me with an account of her - with her name, her parentage, her place of abode.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000189.wav|Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000063.wav|Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and pains, and responsibilities.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000104.wav|Julia's hair curls naturally, returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000400.wav|The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir. The breeze is still: it is quite hot.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000004.wav|My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000431.wav|Not the least.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000187.wav|And Missis Reed?|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000038.wav|A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it:|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000036.wav|The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000124.wav|Jane! will you hear reason? he stooped and approached his lips to my ear; because, if you won't, I'll try violence. His voice was hoarse;|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000172.wav|My bride is here, he said, again drawing me to him, because my equal is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000124.wav|Do you like your house?|0

audio/jane_eyre_06_f000093.wav|Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one, even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them gently;|0

audio/jane_eyre_27_f000413.wav|and these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.|0

audio/jane_eyre_24_f000256.wav|And somewhat relieved by this idea which I failed not to execute that day, I ventured once more to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine,|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000068.wav|Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots:|0

audio/jane_eyre_13_f000112.wav|Yes, said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000413.wav|I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.|0

audio/jane_eyre_06_f000101.wav|I fall into a sort of dream.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000027.wav|independent of the cumbrous body.|0

audio/jane_eyre_11_f000071.wav|Yes, ma'am.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000299.wav|He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.|0

audio/jane_eyre_27_f000490.wav|And it is you, spirit - with will and energy, and virtue and purity - that I want: not alone your brittle frame.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000276.wav|So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000224.wav|Still, when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000387.wav|Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.|0

audio/jane_eyre_22_f000045.wav|I had heard from Missis Fairfax in the interim of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed;|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000037.wav|When I returned to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class,|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000049.wav|During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody - Adele excepted.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000580.wav|I stood up and lifted my hand; it stopped. I asked where it was going: the driver named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mister Rochester had no connections.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000242.wav|that is, playing on her ignorance - her trail might be clever, but it was decidedly not good- natured.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000013.wav|No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins either;|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000044.wav|for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking - no speck of the dirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated,|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000237.wav|People talk of natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver, goodnight!|0

audio/jane_eyre_10_f000150.wav|I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000160.wav|No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000002.wav|Recording by Elisabeth Klett.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000223.wav|She had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000095.wav|A person to be trusted?|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000241.wav|Well did I remember Missis Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image.|0

audio/jane_eyre_03_f000058.wav|Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word book acted as a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from the library.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000050.wav|and for pleasing yourself with this late-found charm of relationship;|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000177.wav|Sit down! - Let me hear what they said about me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000217.wav|But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all air; and neither you nor she can fly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000027.wav|So you shun me? - you shut yourself up and grieve alone!|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000345.wav|I will tell you in your private ear, replied she, wagging her turban three times with portentous significancy.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000051.wav|She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about, examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000080.wav|Then you have been both?|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000017.wav|In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin, thought I: I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000081.wav|He is not at home.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000282.wav|Strange words of a strange love! An austere patriot's passion for his fatherland!|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000049.wav|Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000196.wav|It was not till after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000210.wav|It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your father or your mother dead?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000313.wav|I mean, - What next? How did you proceed? What came of such an event?|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000043.wav|Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said - Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house;|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000059.wav|This book I had again and again perused with delight.|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000137.wav|Perhaps you may - who knows? Have you any relations besides Missis Reed?|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000047.wav|they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived better too.|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000079.wav|I considered; my life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000257.wav|only a sense of mortification.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000066.wav|And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school, my little girl?|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000062.wav|then she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000422.wav|I am very well, sir.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000091.wav|At all events you will come back: you will not be induced under any pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000185.wav|Here it comes again! It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an angel of light.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000199.wav|With less sin I might have - But let me remember to whom I am speaking.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000189.wav|Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane! He staggered.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000078.wav|He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000168.wav|I was silent: I thought he mocked me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000010.wav|And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel;|0

audio/jane_eyre_09_f000075.wav|and sat at a distance under the verandah.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000222.wav|Take care of him, said Mister Rochester to the latter, and keep him at your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to see how he gets on.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000061.wav|Pity! he said, and sighed and paused. It is always the way of events in this life, he continued presently: no sooner have you got settled in a pleasant resting-place,|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000267.wav|I am Jane Eyre.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000035.wav|the sovereign hand that created your frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000060.wav|Shall I, Miss Temple?|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000204.wav|I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000448.wav|and one to this day I feel it impossible to understand:|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000174.wav|There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room,|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000049.wav|I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent on discovering a means of extrication;|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000019.wav|and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check;|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000028.wav|studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape - Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy isles.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000014.wav|Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and Adele were to go downstairs.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000355.wav|And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled? Oh, I know well! That, too, is very clear to my vision.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000326.wav|I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000200.wav|Again the surprised expression crossed his face. He had not imagined that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000148.wav|Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough,|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000093.wav|What, already up! said he, as he entered the nursery. Well, nurse, how is she?|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000144.wav|What must I say?|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000249.wav|Most gentlemen would admire her, I thought; and that he did admire her, I already seemed to have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt,|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000132.wav|all its associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000292.wav|I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome, imposing;|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000092.wav|Mister Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth;|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000078.wav|and as to thinking well of them, I consider some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively:|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000206.wav|It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices,|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000095.wav|Yes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000485.wav|A mere reed she feels in my hand! And he shook me with the force of his hold.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000201.wav|Now place your feet on the stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return;|0

audio/jane_eyre_26_f000144.wav|In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000012.wav|in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Missis Fairfax informed me;|0

audio/jane_eyre_15_f000213.wav|At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone - I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber door.|0
audio/jane_eyre_38_f000012.wav|A short time after she pursued - I seed you go out with the master, but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed; and she basted away.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000144.wav|it is another privilege we exercise in our little moorland home - to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,|0

audio/jane_eyre_37_f000425.wav|I did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy.|0

audio/jane_eyre_21_f000248.wav|Is this Jane Eyre? she said.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000200.wav|What is it about? I continued. I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger;|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000175.wav|Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mister Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000092.wav|It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog,|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000280.wav|I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant for such I now concluded her to be saw the difference.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000254.wav|And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having reached Mister Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000203.wav|God pardon me! he subjoined ere long; and man meddle not with me: I have her, and will hold her.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000225.wav|But joy soon effaced every other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed,|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000206.wav|roused from the nightmare of parting - called to the paradise of union - I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so abundant a flow.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000294.wav|to offer them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000215.wav|then I learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from some hot country:|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000127.wav|Her salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver;|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000136.wav|Well, I asked impatiently, is not Missis Reed a hard-hearted, bad woman?|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000103.wav|The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen - by conflagration: but how kindled? What story belonged to this disaster?|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000212.wav|One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom;|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000067.wav|I did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out - N'est-ce pas,|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000004.wav|Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and solitude I had passed beneath its roof!|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000078.wav|Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I considered.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000054.wav|I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and you try to stir me up to restlessness! To what end?|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000170.wav|It is an old saying that all is not gold that glitters; and in this case I do fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or I expect.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000201.wav|In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother - and only one;|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000096.wav|Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller;|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000166.wav|Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply:|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000053.wav|Yes, I was right: it was Mister Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000023.wav|and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and as I believed, charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000188.wav|to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Missis Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her,|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000404.wav|as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom - when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: Who is that?|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000021.wav|on her hard forehead, and in her commonplace features,|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000137.wav|You live just below - do you mean at that house with the battlements?|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000290.wav|all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000456.wav|You have introduced a topic on which our natures are at variance - a topic we should never discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between us.|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000126.wav|What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me! exclaimed Abbot.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000017.wav|for, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000189.wav|Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000306.wav|One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did not care or know.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000032.wav|The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste;|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000012.wav|Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000262.wav|I then framed and fixed a resolution. While I walked under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched pomegranates and pine-apples,|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000118.wav|not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing - the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent;|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000217.wav|it was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another for that office!|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000104.wav|What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?|0
audio/jane_eyre_38_f000080.wav|He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000061.wav|I want you, he said: come this way: take your time, and make no noise.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000052.wav|About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000041.wav|He soon stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000198.wav|The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered - the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000017.wav|I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict;|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000011.wav|Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000262.wav|most of them are tall, some young.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000330.wav|Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000061.wav|She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain she could not help it, when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness, but not affected;|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000357.wav|John demanded an account - which at present I was far too weak to render - I said after a brief pause - Sir, I can give you no details to-night.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000205.wav|and mademoiselle shall live with me there, and only me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000102.wav|I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I answered promptly, I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate going out in the carriage.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000167.wav|Nothing, indeed, thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000058.wav|A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high- backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady,|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000172.wav|to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000136.wav|I was again ready with my request. Communicate your intentions to Missis|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000187.wav|Have we anything else to stay for? he inquired of Mister Mason.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000107.wav|With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word - very well, Jane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how strangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000026.wav|A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the girls examined.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000346.wav|What, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of matters between you and Rivers?|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000127.wav|they are in no hurry to separate.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000415.wav|You will see what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage:|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000369.wav|Choose then, sir - her who loves you best.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000158.wav|You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000081.wav|I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and,|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000159.wav|Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure, I answered.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000012.wav|There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000102.wav|But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night, said she; it is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel tired.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000109.wav|Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000204.wav|and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000216.wav|I obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000210.wav|I approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees - firs,|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000202.wav|As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him - for he occupied an arm-chair drawn close to the fire,|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000259.wav|At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000023.wav|The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000387.wav|I, too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from me. I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000248.wav|she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000223.wav|His elder brother?|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000167.wav|Is it really for love he is going to marry you? she asked.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000169.wav|she shall, however, be watched, Missis|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000030.wav|As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion,|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000172.wav|to prove you are near me - and I will in a few words show you the real state of the case. Can you listen to me?|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000072.wav|Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000186.wav|not a shilling but what you have given me?|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000111.wav|Independent! What do you mean, Jane?|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000202.wav|And yet where was the Jane Eyre of yesterday? - where was her life? - where were her prospects?|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000051.wav|I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me. Mary, I said, how are you?|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000078.wav|My name is Briggs, a solicitor of Street, London.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000157.wav|and my voice still died away inarticulate;|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000269.wav|I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000334.wav|Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so truthful.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000201.wav|there was no thought on the low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000300.wav|I'll give you a piece of bread, she said, after a pause; but we can't take in a vagrant to lodge. It isn't likely.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000179.wav|Mister Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Rochester.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000269.wav|In what way is he peculiar?|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000159.wav|Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not afraid?|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000118.wav|You know Thornfield Hall, of course? I managed to say at last.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000105.wav|I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000232.wav|I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it sounds strange to me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000043.wav|At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the stony street of L-.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000094.wav|Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't crown me with roses:|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000271.wav|No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000172.wav|The order was now given To the garden! Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000511.wav|without it, my heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love: yes - nobly, generously.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000025.wav|What are you going to do?|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000100.wav|Of course.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000077.wav|to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000157.wav|And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000036.wav|I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000179.wav|I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment,|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000013.wav|further than to receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000182.wav|When she first came here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French;|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000140.wav|Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an automaton?|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000035.wav|Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours rest at night.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000161.wav|Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mister|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000100.wav|all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000047.wav|Will you take my arm, sir? he said; there is a heavy shower coming on: had you not better go in?|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000462.wav|She was by that time laid out. Eliza and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared not go.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000196.wav|The morning had been a quiet morning enough - all except the brief scene with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy;|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000291.wav|Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000281.wav|and the birds fetch their young ones breakfast out of the Thornfield,|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000023.wav|We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the coachman in his seat.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000271.wav|The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library- door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000178.wav|on his way back to Jamaica, happened to be with him.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000217.wav|and I thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mister Rochester's shoulder.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000065.wav|Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances;|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000128.wav|I have known you, Mister Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever.|0
audio/jane_eyre_38_f000067.wav|He cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much;|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000361.wav|Yes, of friends, I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ. He helped me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000153.wav|Yes - to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000215.wav|I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000157.wav|You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000052.wav|Turning to me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly - Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000167.wav|I did what human beings do instinctively when they are driven to utter extremity - looked for aid to one higher than man: the words God help me! burst involuntarily from my lips.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000106.wav|A pretty little house stood at the top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000164.wav|But, was slowly, distinctly read, the fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000540.wav|I had but to go in and to say - Mister Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till death,|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000020.wav|It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000130.wav|I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it was his way.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000036.wav|I was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000305.wav|and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged their services on the agitated fair ones.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000076.wav|And what is he?|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000243.wav|That is strong, she said, when she had finished: I relish it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000174.wav|It is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform - I have strength yet for that - if - but where is the use of thinking of it,|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000463.wav|There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid;|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000142.wav|I reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable poverty;|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000090.wav|if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000055.wav|we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door;|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000045.wav|it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000074.wav|she discovered first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and some sketches,|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000003.wav|Jane eyre by Charlotte Bronte. Chapter 1.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000092.wav|Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000011.wav|Where the sun had gone down in simple state - pure of the pomp of clouds - spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point,|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000096.wav|If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000064.wav|What do you say to that? I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place,|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000123.wav|It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act in that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000142.wav|She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000166.wav|noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000295.wav|Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000195.wav|He bowed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000087.wav|my supposition cannot be correct.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000147.wav|The last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with me, and see me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000008.wav|So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000461.wav|They came to tell us the next morning that all was over.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000214.wav|It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000332.wav|It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000054.wav|I had not notified to Missis Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000022.wav|I was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I heard and saw round me.|0

audio/jane_eyre_10_f000165.wav|Bessie! Bessie! that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half cried, and we both went into the parlour.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000231.wav|I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000160.wav|Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party - all strangers;|0

audio/jane_eyre_03_f000007.wav|Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000229.wav|she is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit down now, Miss Elliott.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000144.wav|No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride;|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000164.wav|I thought I could have done some good.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000224.wav|Yes. The present Mister Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property; only about nine years.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000176.wav|And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000245.wav|I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000102.wav|Now, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate? Do you think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I would much rather have all your confidence.|0

audio/jane_eyre_24_f000137.wav|Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was shocked. Give her some explanation before I see her again. It pains me to be misjudged by so good a woman.|0

audio/jane_eyre_27_f000197.wav|I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her nature:|0

audio/jane_eyre_02_f000100.wav|That certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne?|0

audio/jane_eyre_33_f000167.wav|I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000410.wav|Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital punishment.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000042.wav|I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mister Brocklehurst;|0

audio/jane_eyre_21_f000436.wav|the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty.|0

audio/jane_eyre_14_f000262.wav|I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I'll explain all this some day.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000212.wav|But what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we were all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000026.wav|I devoured the books they lent me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I had perused during the day.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000290.wav|and which is incident to her harassing profession,|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000131.wav|And why had I these aspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason,|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000168.wav|Do not ask me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.|0

audio/jane_eyre_34_f000466.wav|As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature,|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000142.wav|Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000343.wav|He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000130.wav|Where do you see the necessity? he asked suddenly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000277.wav|I took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the pass and down the hollow;|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000169.wav|She is Mister Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for her.|0

audio/jane_eyre_33_f000221.wav|but I perceived soon that Mister Rivers had placed a chair behind me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000086.wav|I should not live long in that climate.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000168.wav|She went on - You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be hungry: - I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000333.wav|I have at last my nameless bliss.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000204.wav|she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000139.wav|The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some life-giving elixir:|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000007.wav|I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000059.wav|Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000324.wav|Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come in - your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad folks about.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000073.wav|and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000285.wav|What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000051.wav|And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket - a jay in borrowed plumes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000065.wav|A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.|0

audio/jane_eyre_24_f000311.wav|I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated a little bungler.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000066.wav|But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000064.wav|I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you must.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000109.wav|and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns;|0

audio/jane_eyre_32_f000132.wav|You did, Mister Rivers.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000184.wav|As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000045.wav|I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in the shade; but Mister Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders,|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000240.wav|It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000038.wav|and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000266.wav|Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.|0

audio/jane_eyre_14_f000124.wav|I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000194.wav|My aunt, consequently?|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000043.wav|I was not dreaming, I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness provoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000351.wav|Would I be quiet and talk rationally?|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000144.wav|No; I should not like to belong to poor people, was my reply.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000317.wav|I dreamed it would be nameless bliss, As I loved, loved to be;|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000213.wav|What dog is this?|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000014.wav|and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse - some three or four shillings:|0

audio/jane_eyre_10_f000159.wav|The carrier, no doubt, I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000105.wav|Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000012.wav|and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded depths of agony.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000500.wav|You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?|0

audio/jane_eyre_18_f000055.wav|The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000103.wav|I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000065.wav|The heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were softened.|0

audio/jane_eyre_28_f000327.wav|I was near, and listened to both you and her. I think this is a peculiar case - I must at least examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house.|0

audio/jane_eyre_03_f000039.wav|For me, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by dread: such dread as children only can feel.|0

audio/jane_eyre_12_f000187.wav|I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase,|0

audio/jane_eyre_08_f000130.wav|and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder.|0

audio/jane_eyre_02_f000085.wav|I could not answer the ceaseless inward question - why I thus suffered; now, at the distance of - I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000427.wav|I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000016.wav|I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000249.wav|John, she has no choice of helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000009.wav|and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000062.wav|Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as to have grown tired of her pure society?|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000050.wav|but he himself looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil - if evil existent or prospective there was - seemed to lie with me only;|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000394.wav|I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000013.wav|The population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and south - white, broad, lonely;|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000155.wav|but John Reed's tastes were no rule for mine,|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000235.wav|comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller books they held in their hands,|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000005.wav|In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day, and walk out sometimes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000028.wav|and this I am sure he did not by force, but on principle.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000057.wav|He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000223.wav|Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his ear that Mister Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here and then leave me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000157.wav|and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table:|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000053.wav|My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water;|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000112.wav|to find it of small dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000157.wav|It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000079.wav|giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head: and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000107.wav|What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?|0
audio/jane_eyre_38_f000031.wav|I soon asked and obtained leave of Mister Rochester, to go and see her at the school where he had placed her.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000184.wav|That I will, Adele; and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my gloomy monitress.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000105.wav|Oh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000206.wav|Georgiana added to her How d'ye do? several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone:|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000190.wav|to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence;|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000328.wav|I could not afford it: schools are so dear.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000143.wav|Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library - I mean, if you please.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000116.wav|If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000107.wav|Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you,|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000321.wav|Why did he wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000200.wav|Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000015.wav|Her plans required all her time and attention, she said;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000341.wav|Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000035.wav|Ay, ay! was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed All right, and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000102.wav|He took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as if its scantiness amused him.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000014.wav|and made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester, as she dubbed him I had not before heard his prenomens,|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000044.wav|Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was attired in oriental fashion:|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000110.wav|and th Rivers wor gentry i th owd days o th Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th registers i Morton Church vestry.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000016.wav|She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of speaking;|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000155.wav|Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire, and have the hearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a good fire?|0

audio/jane_eyre_19_f000136.wav|The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they are;|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000139.wav|You unbend your forehead at last, said Mister Rivers. I thought Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth?|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000264.wav|Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is he liked for himself?|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000183.wav|the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight, - every ring was perfect, the connection complete.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000328.wav|A strapper - a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000041.wav|Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors high stools.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000232.wav|and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000033.wav|They knelt; while Missis Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000031.wav|The feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than was consistent with joy - something that smote and stunned. It was, I think almost fear.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000114.wav|And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which conducted directly to the kitchen.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000143.wav|He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and deeply gratified.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000308.wav|Not you. I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about folk's houses at this time o night.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000143.wav|Here was a new stunner - I had been calculating on four or five thousand.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000169.wav|Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000131.wav|No, sir.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000017.wav|My head swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken no breakfast.|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000077.wav|Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; A long time ago came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000080.wav|and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted,|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000229.wav|Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my palette. Once more he looked at the portrait.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000192.wav|Were you happy when you painted these pictures? asked Mister Rochester presently.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000257.wav|Close union! Intimate attachment!|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000127.wav|but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it - to answer what he asked without pretension,|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000087.wav|Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am careless;|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000007.wav|and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000013.wav|I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the boots placed for my convenience,|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000159.wav|I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:|0

audio/jane_eyre_26_f000222.wav|it begot an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind,|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000070.wav|and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you:|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000105.wav|ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must enter.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000187.wav|Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000028.wav|I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000167.wav|Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil? thought I.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000148.wav|The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000098.wav|The thought of Missis O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed,|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000020.wav|looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000076.wav|The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000118.wav|Having completed her task, she rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I suppose, of making the most of daylight,|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000409.wav|Ha! explain! commanded the lady.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000184.wav|I knew, by instinct, how the matter stood, before St.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000101.wav|sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with coldness and acrimony.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000230.wav|I regarded her, of course, with special interest. First, I wished to see whether her appearance accorded with Missis Fairfax's description;|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000113.wav|That's for you, nurse, said he; you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000071.wav|and still more in pondering the problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody that morning, or,|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000013.wav|At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from task to task, too, bewildered me;|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000217.wav|John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly - he kissed me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000094.wav|I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000294.wav|I saw them smile, laugh - it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh.|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000008.wav|Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I felt ready to perish with cold.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000101.wav|A pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000236.wav|compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000095.wav|One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure me of my faults;|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000085.wav|A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians;|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000163.wav|I will not give him that trouble, I answered. I will go, if no better may be; but I don't like it. Shall you be there, Missis Fairfax?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000072.wav|I must be ice and rock to him; and ice and rock you will accordingly become.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000128.wav|I smiled: I thought to myself Mister Rochester is peculiar - he seems to forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.|0

audio/jane_eyre_26_f000212.wav|I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say he had betrayed me;|0

audio/jane_eyre_35_f000037.wav|but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000166.wav|I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000246.wav|My darling Blanche! recollect - I do - I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will - quick, Sam!|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000131.wav|I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you.|0

audio/jane_eyre_37_f000231.wav|Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you;|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000078.wav|I felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior;|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000154.wav|a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000361.wav|a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000232.wav|He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000168.wav|He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with some stress, limped to his horse.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000032.wav|Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken,|0
audio/jane_eyre_38_f000032.wav|Her frantic joy at beholding me again moved me much.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000162.wav|I felt the distance between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the village schoolmistress.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000147.wav|He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute, disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000115.wav|bending over me with strange pity.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000193.wav|Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a month, my image will be effaced from her heart.|0

audio/jane_eyre_37_f000054.wav|I answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen, where John now sat by a good fire.|0

audio/jane_eyre_14_f000184.wav|I believe it was an inspiration rather than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing - I know that.|0

audio/jane_eyre_12_f000024.wav|I valued what was good in Missis Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness,|0

audio/jane_eyre_20_f000104.wav|I must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly countenance - these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose - these eyes now shut, now opening,|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000076.wav|Mister Reed was my uncle - my mother's brother.|0

audio/jane_eyre_11_f000057.wav|contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view.|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000137.wav|He lifted his gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned it on her.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000225.wav|Tell me where I can get you a glass of water, said St. John; you must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000137.wav|then she whispered - Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000152.wav|Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for its contents being original;|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000064.wav|Have you a sponge in your room? he asked in a whisper.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000012.wav|Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in my mind.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000257.wav|And while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,|0

audio/jane_eyre_14_f000126.wav|Humph! Promptly spoken. But I won't allow that, seeing that it would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both advantages.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000053.wav|I looked at him with surprise. St. John, I said, I think you are almost wicked to talk so.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000439.wav|The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be communicated or discussed.|0

audio/jane_eyre_01_f000091.wav|Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000229.wav|I shall remember how you thrust me back - roughly and violently thrust me back - into the red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000177.wav|in passing, she lifted her eyes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000120.wav|there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000362.wav|Ah! Jane. But I want a wife.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000179.wav|The new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory;|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000069.wav|Who talks of cadeaux? said he gruffly. Did you expect a present, Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents? and he searched my face with eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.|0

audio/jane_eyre_18_f000134.wav|, of the parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000201.wav|And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000191.wav|Just to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarming, when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am sure, you are more like a brownie.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000148.wav|St. John had a book in his hand - it was his unsocial custom to read at meals - he closed it, and looked up.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000059.wav|Why, Jane? I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer for you - Because I have a wife already, you would reply. - I guess rightly?|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000040.wav|One reason of the distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at home:|0

audio/jane_eyre_11_f000028.wav|I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.|0

audio/jane_eyre_28_f000080.wav|I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.|0

audio/jane_eyre_05_f000120.wav|but the first edge of hunger blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000355.wav|I dared to put off the mendicant - to resume my natural manner and character.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000158.wav|The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down. Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.|0

audio/jane_eyre_25_f000267.wav|With little Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood - so tranquil, so passionless, so innocent - and waited for the coming day:|0

audio/jane_eyre_17_f000289.wav|He made me love him without looking at me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000143.wav|but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000151.wav|Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mister Rochester galloped at her side; the two rode a little apart from the rest.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000345.wav|and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000150.wav|It is a mere stump - a ghastly sight! Don't you think so, Jane?|0

audio/jane_eyre_11_f000277.wav|Mister Rochester was Mister Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor - nothing more:|0

audio/jane_eyre_31_f000095.wav|And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog is quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field,|0

audio/jane_eyre_25_f000249.wav|And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.|0

audio/jane_eyre_32_f000176.wav|I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.|0

audio/jane_eyre_22_f000032.wav|How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000193.wav|That's well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a dose myself, on my own responsibility.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000042.wav|If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000078.wav|Yet, I reflected, she has been young once; her youth would be contemporary with her master's: Missis Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years.|0

audio/jane_eyre_37_f000294.wav|Once or twice.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000011.wav|then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000011.wav|I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone:|0

audio/jane_eyre_27_f000010.wav|I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me; and Conscience,|0

audio/jane_eyre_27_f000384.wav|You entered the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly dressed - much as you are now.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000061.wav|I knew Mister Rochester; though the begrimed face, the disordered dress his coat hanging loose from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle,|0

audio/jane_eyre_04_f000239.wav|No, Missis Reed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000273.wav|All at once I heard a clear voice call, Miss Jane! where are you? Come to lunch!|0

audio/jane_eyre_32_f000182.wav|Strange indeed! I could not help ejaculating.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000015.wav|I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard.|0

audio/jane_eyre_17_f000408.wav|Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000164.wav|I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed; people had something else to think about;|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000312.wav|No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid. Nor was I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000299.wav|Then I must speak for it, continued the deep, relentless voice. Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000099.wav|Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.|0

audio/jane_eyre_25_f000134.wav|Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought;|0

audio/jane_eyre_15_f000120.wav|His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000153.wav|Again I questioned, but this time only in thought. Where is that region?|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000370.wav|I will at least choose - her I love best. Jane, will you marry me?|0

audio/jane_eyre_35_f000206.wav|I could vow to marry you here and now - come afterwards what would!|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000058.wav|I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries.|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000142.wav|I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000021.wav|I mounted into the window- seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.|0

audio/jane_eyre_27_f000519.wav|I watched her come - watched with the strangest anticipation;|0

audio/jane_eyre_17_f000107.wav|Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.|0

audio/jane_eyre_02_f000075.wav|I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to night.|0

audio/jane_eyre_27_f000034.wav|Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man who had but one little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread and drank of his cup,|0

audio/jane_eyre_15_f000016.wav|but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence.|0

audio/jane_eyre_21_f000425.wav|Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell her. - Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000062.wav|To prolong doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of her star.|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000178.wav|Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, Poor Miss Jane is to be pitied, too, Abbot.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000138.wav|a quaint assemblage they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible;|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000311.wav|I almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the suspended revelation;|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000192.wav|After a considerable pause, I said - And Miss Oliver? Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000093.wav|Indeed, cried Rosamond, she is clever enough to be a governess in a high family, papa.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000430.wav|and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words - Where are you?|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000181.wav|that, in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000108.wav|I only ask you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever!|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000073.wav|He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her?|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000076.wav|Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000123.wav|shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled;|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000211.wav|You have taken my confidence by storm, he continued, and now it is much at your service.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000099.wav|and now you are here I shall be quite gay.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000135.wav|The forehead declares, Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild chasms.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000069.wav|I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000149.wav|That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes,|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000125.wav|for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting fears about the new sphere, et cetera:|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000108.wav|I was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me, and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000131.wav|He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find in him a brother,|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000198.wav|I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it to Mason.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000375.wav|I tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000221.wav|felt that though enfeebled I was not ill, and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000097.wav|and he stirred, lifted his strong arm - he could have struck Mason,|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000139.wav|Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000277.wav|I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000113.wav|I am little better than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God,|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000148.wav|but as all eyes were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and encountered the personage who had received me last night.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000116.wav|Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000143.wav|The solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000277.wav|Do you remember what you said of Celine Varens? - of the diamonds, the cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Celine Varens.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000194.wav|She sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were now full.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000135.wav|At dead of night! I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality at Thornfield. Was it known how it originated? I demanded.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000117.wav|Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening;|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000231.wav|and insists upon being brought in before the quality, to tell them their fortunes. Would you like to see her?|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000128.wav|Since he was not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the Antipodes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000139.wav|The hall lamp was now lit, and it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000156.wav|He has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000069.wav|The cook here turned to me, saying that Missis Fairfax was waiting for me: so I departed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000048.wav|met my eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000248.wav|so I answered him with a contented smile.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000209.wav|Of her daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000393.wav|The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be married instantly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000095.wav|Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000168.wav|She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart, said Mason.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000129.wav|Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the way.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000142.wav|Mister Rochester's.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000286.wav|And she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed about to withdraw to the parlour.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000131.wav|Yes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000027.wav|I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mister Rochester entering.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000014.wav|as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000051.wav|Let Miss Eyre be seated, said he: and there was something in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express,|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000537.wav|I would have got past Mister Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced to stop also.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000157.wav|Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than the expansive.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000057.wav|Why?|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000023.wav|One of the gentlemen, Mister Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000198.wav|I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000110.wav|Who recommended you to come here?|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000177.wav|When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000243.wav|I think I hear Missis Fairfax move, sir, said I.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000245.wav|Are you an orphan?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000523.wav|It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart - My daughter, flee temptation.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000038.wav|and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs,|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000018.wav|and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee,|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000365.wav|Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000148.wav|that something, I, at intervals, beheld still;|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000189.wav|Now, I've another errand for you, said my untiring master; you must away to my room again.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000060.wav|Yes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000105.wav|you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000068.wav|These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again looking on Mister Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they added - Hasten!|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000217.wav|Who subscribes?|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000090.wav|What do you mean?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000190.wav|She flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and accomplishments.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000014.wav|that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner - something lighter,|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000423.wav|I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000162.wav|The superintendent of Lowood for such was this lady having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class round her,|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000223.wav|Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000250.wav|the moon was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball - she threw her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000046.wav|for they had proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house;|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000224.wav|and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mister Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door,|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000013.wav|Let me be torn away, then I cried. Let another help me!|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000274.wav|There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things:|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000126.wav|They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by the kitchen door.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000121.wav|Because you are sorry to leave it?|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000207.wav|It led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000090.wav|You'll like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000032.wav|by her side walked Mister Rochester, and together they drew near the table.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000198.wav|He was never married, and had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000517.wav|The light that long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000197.wav|That will do; - now wet the lip of the phial.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000121.wav|and I knew jealousy would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000092.wav|I am sure most people would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour;|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000105.wav|Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of treating it entirely to yourself.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000214.wav|by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has affected her.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000122.wav|Leah smiled, and even Sophie bid me bon soir with glee.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000011.wav|gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000128.wav|and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable, proper, en regle.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000070.wav|What tale do you like best to hear?|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000119.wav|Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses - soul and senses quivering with keen throes - I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000201.wav|It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000183.wav|but he implored Mister Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000177.wav|One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems,|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000152.wav|Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride - saw only them, heard only their discourse,|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000083.wav|while Adele was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000143.wav|I wish to foster, not to blight - to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood - no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet - That will do.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000440.wav|Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000260.wav|Willingly would I now have gone and asked Missis Reed's pardon;|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000264.wav|for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to follow.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000189.wav|The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect;|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000148.wav|She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000022.wav|He said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000188.wav|He shuddered.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000006.wav|whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000054.wav|I know.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000224.wav|We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way;|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000081.wav|I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000298.wav|Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000278.wav|his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000082.wav|I recall their interchanged glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000166.wav|I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mister|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000005.wav|I now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting should not be barren on my side.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000152.wav|She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the piano. She and Mister Rochester sang a duet.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000039.wav|and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings,|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000052.wav|What do you want? I asked, with awkward diffidence.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000182.wav|I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000404.wav|I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000088.wav|besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug;|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000192.wav|Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000032.wav|How long shall we be before we get there?|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000423.wav|and the alpha and omega of my heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words - Jane!|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000297.wav|I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to dread.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000156.wav|What?|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000048.wav|I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000246.wav|she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat, remained fixed like a statue in its niche. The sisters were both attired in spotless white.|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000120.wav|Meantime, you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why Mister Briggs sought after you - what he wanted with you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000317.wav|He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he came back he was humming a tune.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000009.wav|no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000177.wav|Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child:|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000135.wav|Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000168.wav|Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Missis Fairfax.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000130.wav|Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room:|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000291.wav|You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come there to see you?|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000035.wav|Whether is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000231.wav|Have mercy, Aunt Reed! And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me - knocked me down for nothing.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000058.wav|Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000086.wav|wherein she differed diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me handsome.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000033.wav|because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000308.wav|I thought it must be you: there is no one else for it. What shall I tell her?|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000038.wav|The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000119.wav|Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder;|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000155.wav|Keep out of the way, said Mister Rochester, thrusting her aside: she has no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000009.wav|I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day fortnight.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000254.wav|promise me to go to the nursery.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000085.wav|And what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead before you reach her:|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000013.wav|While Mister Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000161.wav|but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000255.wav|I shall be very glad to do so, sir.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000230.wav|Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mister Rochester, reader, amidst these changes of place and fortune.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000070.wav|it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly;|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000127.wav|Answer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will not suffer from your dishonest coquetry? Won't she feel forsaken and deserted?|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000207.wav|First, there was Missis Eshton and two of her daughters.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000024.wav|this useful existence - after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,|0

audio/jane_eyre_02_f000122.wav|My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down;|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000122.wav|The two younger of the trio fine girls of sixteen and seventeen had grey beaver hats, then in fashion,|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000051.wav|From the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000234.wav|I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000113.wav|he's dished - But, mother, I did not come to hear Mister Rochester's fortune: I came to hear my own;|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000136.wav|What age were you when you went to Lowood?|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000063.wav|Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance:|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000112.wav|It was a pity: if she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000019.wav|Miss Ingram is mine, of course, said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and Missis Dent.|0

audio/jane_eyre_05_f000269.wav|End of chapter 5.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000125.wav|Not as a husband.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000115.wav|and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000204.wav|This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two- leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons,|0

audio/jane_eyre_11_f000334.wav|Adele came running to meet us in the hall, exclaiming - Mesdames, vous etes servies! adding, J'ai bien faim, moi!|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000247.wav|And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mister Rochester would be likely to make? I could not tell - I did not know his taste in female beauty.|0

audio/jane_eyre_36_f000182.wav|I witnessed, and several more witnessed, Mister Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we heard him call Bertha!|0

audio/jane_eyre_20_f000096.wav|You will not speak to him on any pretext - and - Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak to her:|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000033.wav|Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000118.wav|An impulse held me fast - a force turned me round. I said - or something in me said for me, and in spite of me - Thank you, Mister Rochester, for your great kindness.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000174.wav|We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother, she murmured.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000021.wav|The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar, - I will take one now, if you will excuse me.|0

audio/jane_eyre_27_f000166.wav|To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to yield was out of the question.|0

audio/jane_eyre_21_f000154.wav|I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.|0

audio/jane_eyre_04_f000109.wav|such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask,|0

audio/jane_eyre_35_f000121.wav|It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you undertook - one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak.|0

audio/jane_eyre_34_f000228.wav|Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000088.wav|The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000313.wav|At last I looked up at the tardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000297.wav|I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under it;|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000155.wav|He has said the same thing to me, I replied.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000140.wav|We all must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000287.wav|He approved of them - yes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000105.wav|Ere many minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something - a resource, or at least an informant.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000238.wav|Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mister Rochester's trials.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000201.wav|and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000095.wav|Jane, my little darling so I will call you, for so you are, you don't know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because she is mad I hate her.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000021.wav|or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000348.wav|You are looking grave. You disapprove of me still, I see.|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000304.wav|for the love of heaven, to give me a song.|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000009.wav|Breakfast-time came at last, and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been doubled.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000274.wav|It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step came tripping down the path.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000123.wav|Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000132.wav|It surprised me when I first discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife;|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000057.wav|and I wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often wont to do.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000270.wav|and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's movements!|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000042.wav|You must have been dreaming.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000064.wav|Bridewell! exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000141.wav|The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000261.wav|Oh, no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me - but, unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000107.wav|The head was finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off;|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000229.wav|little Adele came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000274.wav|in whose emotions I had a part.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000046.wav|I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon myself. I was in the library - sitting in his chair - he was quite near.|0
audio/jane_eyre_05_f000114.wav|who installed herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom lady presided at the other.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000071.wav|and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000098.wav|Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for Missis Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot.|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000082.wav|Why did they send me so far and so lonely, Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000177.wav|And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of preference - equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the world to a dependent and a novice.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000391.wav|she was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000108.wav|Hannah soon had a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000046.wav|At this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton - I say lonely,|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000482.wav|that he had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000084.wav|And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000463.wav|This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000072.wav|That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since, said he, and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains,|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000054.wav|Am I wanted? I asked.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000084.wav|the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000182.wav|Remember, we are bid to work while it is day - warned that the night cometh when no man shall work.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000016.wav|so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room:|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000092.wav|Yet that she should be found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mister Briggs,|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000063.wav|I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not to my home I was going,|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000061.wav|You will, said she, passing her arm round me. And now tell me who is the lady whom Mister Brocklehurst called your benefactress?|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000161.wav|They say she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000577.wav|I had some fear - or hope - that here I should die: but I was soon up;|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000105.wav|Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now; and you too: it darkens.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000016.wav|What does Bessie say I have done? I asked.|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000143.wav|I have as much soul as you, - and full as much heart!|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000150.wav|whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some dog howling at a distance.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000180.wav|and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000043.wav|and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission of love or duty - I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.|0
audio/jane_eyre_03_f000029.wav|You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better soon, no doubt.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000057.wav|His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000258.wav|And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000214.wav|You are human and fallible.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000336.wav|End of chapter 11.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000166.wav|You must go into the drawing- room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table;|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000061.wav|I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000164.wav|and had a spite at her - and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000111.wav|Still, she allowed, the owd maister was like other folk - naught mich out o t common way: stark mad o shooting, and farming, and sich like.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000084.wav|especially Celine, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects - deformities she termed them.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000329.wav|I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000234.wav|but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000051.wav|I knew on such a gloomy evening Mister Rochester would like to see a cheerful hearth when he came in:|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000084.wav|a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000092.wav|and so on - Sir, I interrupted him, you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:|0
audio/jane_eyre_07_f000172.wav|and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000206.wav|He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly;|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000310.wav|I slipped out of the room, unobserved by any eye - for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned - and I closed the door quietly behind me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000347.wav|The case is very plain before me. In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land - Mister Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me?|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000224.wav|I was rich enough now - yet poor to hideous indigence:|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000100.wav|My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk;|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000131.wav|My things were indeed in shameful disorder, murmured Helen to me, in a low voice: I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000225.wav|she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead,|0
audio/jane_eyre_23_f000222.wav|He kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000445.wav|It would to obey you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000286.wav|At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000297.wav|Such society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back - higher wishes, purer feelings;|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000094.wav|I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour, or perhaps two hours:|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000066.wav|and that he is not thinking of you.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000350.wav|Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000205.wav|Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her figure; I perused her features.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000240.wav|Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and heard her daily: something of her breath faugh!|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000154.wav|I was speaking of myself.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000013.wav|and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000067.wav|Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.|0
audio/jane_eyre_01_f000086.wav|but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however;|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000526.wav|It was yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000005.wav|It was one afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds:|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000201.wav|and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that, when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000025.wav|In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Missis Fairfax came in,|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000146.wav|her eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred by unwonted tidings.|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000035.wav|while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit, &c.|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000060.wav|and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000062.wav|She had been all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty lineaments.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000045.wav|Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I never saw before or since.|0
audio/jane_eyre_06_f000049.wav|the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000067.wav|nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated my heart.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000222.wav|I know she had a particular wish to see me, I added, and I would not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.|0
