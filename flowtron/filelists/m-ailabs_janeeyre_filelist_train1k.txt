audio/jane_eyre_25_f000171.wav|I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source of your melancholy in a dream.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000153.wav|Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me - on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.|0

audio/jane_eyre_30_f000030.wav|In her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.|0

audio/jane_eyre_11_f000176.wav|I looked at my pupil, who did not at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale,|0

audio/jane_eyre_20_f000271.wav|and with me, in, as you characteristically say, all that is right:|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000162.wav|for, after all, Mister Rochester and - because closely connected with him - Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000128.wav|Lastly, I saw Mister Mason was submissive to Mister Rochester;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000285.wav|I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000158.wav|I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries.|0

audio/jane_eyre_29_f000045.wav|and which seemed so to degrade me, left - I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000169.wav|I would rather be incensed than saddened.|0
audio/jane_eyre_02_f000080.wav|and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression - as running away,|0

audio/jane_eyre_21_f000264.wav|But there was something I wished to say - let me see - The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000013.wav|On Thursday afternoons half-holidays we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.|0

audio/jane_eyre_17_f000065.wav|I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave;|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000114.wav|Don't trouble yourself to give her a character, returned Mister Rochester: eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She began by felling my horse.|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000219.wav|May it be right then, I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness to me;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000314.wav|I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large.|0

audio/jane_eyre_08_f000138.wav|About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple, who had written to Mister Lloyd, received his answer:|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000057.wav|He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000004.wav|Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in accomplishing her task;|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000344.wav|She seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her;|0
audio/jane_eyre_14_f000191.wav|Here, come in, bonny wanderer!|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000087.wav|And you came from - ?|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000291.wav|Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.|0
audio/jane_eyre_29_f000080.wav|The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mister St. John Rivers?|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000144.wav|I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum; but I dare not.|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000195.wav|Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I pity him, for my part.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000195.wav|Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian?|0

audio/jane_eyre_37_f000263.wav|His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste? - priggish and parsonic?|0

audio/jane_eyre_22_f000077.wav|Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment I am beyond my own mastery.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000263.wav|Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him how to avert the danger.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000332.wav|St. John, who is it? I heard one ask.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000189.wav|she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes,|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000093.wav|he experienced, too, a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000052.wav|I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000085.wav|and while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000077.wav|I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Missis Fairfax showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry;|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000054.wav|Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast through the room and came back;|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000076.wav|Without speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.|0

audio/jane_eyre_15_f000157.wav|I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000183.wav|He went to college, and he got - plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man,|0
audio/jane_eyre_36_f000107.wav|Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements;|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000201.wav|That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.|0
audio/jane_eyre_19_f000064.wav|But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but your future school?|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000229.wav|This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft: it is the work of nature. She was roused, and did - no miracle - but her best.|0

audio/jane_eyre_18_f000113.wav|But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mister Rochester, to witness their repeated failure - herself unconscious that they did fail;|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000019.wav|perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and benefited them;|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000333.wav|She had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly handsome.|0
audio/jane_eyre_13_f000049.wav|but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never lifted his head as we approached.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000150.wav|Ah! sir, she sees you! exclaimed Grace: you'd better not stay.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000341.wav|Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading.|0

audio/jane_eyre_37_f000348.wav|But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I do love you, you would be proud and content.|0
audio/jane_eyre_27_f000029.wav|You are passionate. I expected a scene of some kind.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000153.wav|Mister Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000198.wav|a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud;|0
audio/jane_eyre_18_f000077.wav|I did not now watch the actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise;|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000215.wav|Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere.|0
audio/jane_eyre_25_f000193.wav|Sophie! Sophie! I again cried: and still it was silent.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000359.wav|Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.|0
audio/jane_eyre_26_f000189.wav|The clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.|0

audio/jane_eyre_32_f000086.wav|He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud personage; but he was very kind to me.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000067.wav|What to do? - where to go?|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000148.wav|End of chapter 22.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000026.wav|when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the voiture I had given Celine.|0
audio/jane_eyre_28_f000030.wav|I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000082.wav|Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in the glass, I said.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000172.wav|Hush! say nothing - my heart is full of delight - my senses are entranced - let the time I marked pass in peace.|0

audio/jane_eyre_34_f000082.wav|He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs,|0
audio/jane_eyre_33_f000109.wav|Very well, he answered quietly: and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000081.wav|chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study - and I was going to speak,|0
audio/jane_eyre_31_f000010.wav|This morning, the village school opened. I had twenty scholars.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000129.wav|and Mister Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him;|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000027.wav|Good morning, Grace, I said. Has anything happened here? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.|0
audio/jane_eyre_17_f000355.wav|Theodore, do you remember those merry days?|0
audio/jane_eyre_24_f000233.wav|Put it, she said, on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000202.wav|By the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham.|0
audio/jane_eyre_15_f000043.wav|Some hated thought seemed to have him in its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.|0
audio/jane_eyre_10_f000013.wav|Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation;|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000122.wav|but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her father had taught her,|0

audio/jane_eyre_34_f000342.wav|Very willingly, he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000393.wav|and as often on week-days as there were prayers.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000428.wav|There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never blight,|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000240.wav|I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000007.wav|and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000126.wav|Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000105.wav|There, sir - and there! I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes - I swept his hair from his brow, and kissed that too.|0
audio/jane_eyre_16_f000020.wav|She was intent on her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed:|0
audio/jane_eyre_22_f000146.wav|If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000030.wav|had once saved my life, and that we were near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.|0
audio/jane_eyre_34_f000051.wav|but then, I hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.|0
audio/jane_eyre_09_f000143.wav|But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?|0
audio/jane_eyre_35_f000179.wav|If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000027.wav|Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.|0
audio/jane_eyre_08_f000143.wav|Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty:|0
audio/jane_eyre_12_f000208.wav|I hastened to Missis Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no candle, and no Missis Fairfax.|0
audio/jane_eyre_21_f000453.wav|She said I oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.|0

audio/jane_eyre_15_f000080.wav|A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her dupe.|0
audio/jane_eyre_20_f000319.wav|Curse you? No, sir.|0
audio/jane_eyre_04_f000024.wav|and crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.|0
audio/jane_eyre_30_f000177.wav|St. John passed the window reading a letter. He entered.|0
audio/jane_eyre_32_f000028.wav|I still again and again met Mister Rochester, always at some exciting crisis;|0
audio/jane_eyre_37_f000169.wav|Blind as he was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his lineaments softened and warmed.|0
audio/jane_eyre_11_f000224.wav|She made me lift my hand - so - to remind me to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?|0
